# Eco Warriors

Eco-Warriors was inspired by the simple thought - what if a small idea could scale to a global level, making a real difference in the process. This is how the app was born, bringing to life a fun and rewarding game that helps users to team up and clear litter in their local area.

The app also provided an opportunity for us to push our technical knowledge as a team, going beyond our comfort zones to build a robust and highly scalable stack. Utilising docker for the first time and tying together cloud services from AWS to Google to Digital Ocean, we made full use of modern deployment methods and built for a forward-looking approach.
